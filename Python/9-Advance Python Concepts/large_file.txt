Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating machines that can simulate human intelligence and cognitive functions, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. 
AI systems learn from vast amounts of data to identify patterns, adapt, and perform tasks that typically require human intellect, like understanding language, recognizing objects, and making recommendations. 
This technology drives innovation across industries, including healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, though it also raises important ethical and privacy concerns.
